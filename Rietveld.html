<h3>The remarkably simple appearance of this chair belies its complex dovetailed construction, leading Gerrit Rietveld to describe it as his &#8220;designer&#8217;s joke.&#8221; The four rectangular planes meet at angles, requiring dovetailed joints and reinforcement by screws and wooden wedges. Visually, however, the chair is cohesive and anticipates the single-piece molded construction of 1960s plastic chairs. Rietveld aimed to design a functional chair reduced to its most basic parts and with minimal space displacement. As a prominent member of the Dutch De Stijl (The Style) design movement, architect/designer Rietveld adhered to the group&#8217;s advocacy of pure abstraction and universality through a reduction to the essentials of form and color. With just base, support, seat, and back, Rietveld&#8217;s totally deconstructed chair bears no resemblance to previous furniture forms.</h3>
